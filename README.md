# Fleetio API
## Working with fleetio api to issue HTTP requests

This program was built with the aim of learning how to write HTTP requests to retrieve data from a website using their API
It involves issuing GET, POST, DELETE and PATCH requests.

The main method in the GetFleetIO class issues a standard GET request.

The Deserialize class filters the response by some parameter and stores the properties in an object of the Vehicle class

All code is well commented for easy understanding.
